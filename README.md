# Modelling of Reaction Diffusion System with the Framework of Irreversible Thermodynamics. 
Final project for the course TKJ4200 - Irreversible Thermodynamics. Analyzes how the entropy production is correlated with the formation of specific patterns in reaction-diffusion systems, and if there is a relationship between the entropy production and the stability of the patterns by employing numerical simulations of a simplified model of the Belousov-Zhabotonsky reaction. Additionally, the choice of transport parameters and initial concentration profiles is examined through basic machine learning procedures. The code used for the simulations can be found over at: https://github.com/bre-s/rx_diffusion.git. The report is uploaded here in pdf-format as rx_diff.
